# Exercise 1: creating and operating on vectors

# Create a vector `names` that contains your name and the names of 2 people 
# next to you. Print the vector.

names <- c("Mark", "Elaine")
print(names)
# Use the colon operator : to create a vector `n` of numbers from 10:49

n <- (10:49)

# Use the `length()` function to get the number of elements in `n`

length(n)
# Add 1 to each element in `n` and print the result

n_1 <- n+1
print(n_1)

# Create a vector `m` that contains the numbers 10 to 1 (in that order). 
# Hint: use the `seq()` function

m <- seq(10,1)
# Subtract `m` FROM `n`. Note the recycling!

print(n-m)

# Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of numbers from -5 to 10 in `0.1`
# increments. Store it in a variable `x_range`

x_range <- seq(-5,10,by=0.1)

# Create a vector `sin_wave` by calling the `sin()` function on each element 
# in `x_range`.

sin_wave <- sin(x_range)

# Create a vector `cos_wave` by calling the `cos()` function on each element 
# in `x_range`.

cos_wave <- cos(x_range)

# Create a vector `wave` by multiplying `sin_wave` and `cos_wave` together, then
# adding `sin_wave` to the product

wave <- sin_wave * cos_wave

# Use the `plot()` function to plot your `wave`!

plot(wave)
