# Exercise 1
In this exercise, you'll practice working with branches, including **merging** changes between them.

To complete the exercise, follow the below steps:

1. Clone _this_ exercise repository.

2. Open up _this_ `README.md` file in a text editor (i.e., Atom). Be sure to open the one in the `exercise-1` folder!

3. Create and `checkout` a new branch called `experiment`

4. Add a sentence at the bottom of the `README.md` file. What you had for breakfast is fine. Remember to save your changes to disk!

  (With Atom on Windows, you will need to close the editor before you commit).

5. Commit your change (hint: use `git commit -am "msg"` to add and commit at once!)

6. `checkout` the `master` branch. You should see your previous sentence disappear!

7. Add yet another sentence **at the top of the file** --- for example, a title or subtitle.

8. Commit your change

9. Switch between the experiment and master branches (clicking on your editor in-between). Do you see the file contents changing? Note: In some editors (i.e., Atom for Windows) you may need to close and re-open the file to see the changes.

10. Now `merge` the contents from `experiment` ___into___ `master`. Remember you'll want to switch to the `master` branch first (the one you are merging ___into___).
