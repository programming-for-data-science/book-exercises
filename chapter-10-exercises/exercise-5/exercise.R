# Exercise 5: large data sets: Baby Name Popularity Over Time

# Read in the female baby names data file found in the `data` folder into a 
# variable called `names`. Remember to NOT treat the strings as factors!


# Create a data frame `names_2013` that contains only the rows for the year 2013


# What was the most popular female name in 2013?


# Write a function `most_popular_in_year` that takes in a year as a value and 
# returns the most popular name in that year


# What was the most popular female name in 1994?


# Write a function `number_in_million` that takes in a name and a year, and 
# returns statistically how many babies out of 1 million born that year have 
# that name. 
# Hint: get the popularity percentage, and take that percentage out of 1 million.


# How many babies out of 1 million had the name 'Laura' in 1995?


# How many babies out of 1 million had your name in the year you were born?


## Consider: what does this tell you about how easy it is to identify you with 
## just your name and birth year?
