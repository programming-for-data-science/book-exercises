# Exercise 2: using built-in string functions

# Create a variable `lyric` that contains the text "I like to eat apples and 
# bananas"


# Use the `substr()` function to extract the 1st through 13th letters from the 
# `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `intro`
# Use `?substr` to see more about this function


# Use the `substr()` function to extract the 15th through the last letter of the 
# `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `fruits`
# Hint: use `nchar()` to determine how many total letters there are!


# Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "ee".
# Store the result in a variable called `fruits_e`
# Hint: see http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/sub.php for a simpmle example (or 
# use `?gsub`)


# Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "o".
# Store the result in a variable called `fruits_o`


# Create a new variable `lyric_e` that is the `intro` combined with the new
# `fruits_e` ending. Print out this variable


# Without making a new variable, print out the `intro` combined with the new
# `fruits_o` ending
